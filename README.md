# RefactoringBasicsSummer25
School project during summer 25

This is the tutorial I followed - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oxS33D9-T4
Beneath are the changes I made

First of all I decided to add a loop in the program to easier test each part

Next I changed the "int num1" and "int num2" and "int result" to doubble to be able to use larger numbers as well as "half" numbers (1.5 / 5.3 like such)

I tidied up the "welcome message" and all the other "Console.WriteLine("");" parts for easier understanding and a more pleasant look

I changed the selection of the Operations to be able to use the actual symbols instead of using alphabetical letters

Lastly I changed the "math" section, instead of using "if" and "else if" I used "case" and "break" to make the code more compact and easier to read.
